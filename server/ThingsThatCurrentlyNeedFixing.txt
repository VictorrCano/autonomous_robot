Things to fix: Object Avoidance when block pushing. Technically it should work? Probably need to increase the object avoidance sensor just for that. This is decently important.
Obstacle placement prediction-Its a bit off. Test and change Very important but simple


Things that need checking:
Edward's method that I replaced. Should be good, its pretty simple.
Id like to see block pushing work very well. 
LineAndCorrect. I kinda need that tbh. I need to correct the odometer.
Im assuming Taylor's method is working.
